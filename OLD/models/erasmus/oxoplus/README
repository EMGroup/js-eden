This is the model for OXO-like games as described in the OXO paper
presented at PPIG in 1994. This directory includes the explicit
definitive scripts required to play the OXO-like games:

o Standard "noughts and crosses": OXO [oxo]

o OXO in three dimensions, using a 4x4x4 grid (as a game with 3x3x3 is
  trivial to win for the first player to go). [oxo4]

o OXO on the 7 point finite projective plane over GF(2) (each point is
  coordinatised by three bits eg 010 and three points lie on a line if
  their binary sum is 000). [pp7].

To start this model, run
  ttyeden game.e
and then choose which variant of OXO you wish to play.

game.e includes files in this order, with the exact names of the first
two files depending upon which game you want to play.

> /* game.e */
>
> include("geomoxo.e");
> include("oxo.geom");
>
> include("display.e");
> include("initsq");
> include("status.e");
> include("sqvals.e");
> include("play.e");
> include("gamestate.e");
> include("control.e");

In this sequence of includes the first two files are specific
to the OXO game: the others are generic for all OXO_like games. 

Virtually all of the model is captured in the descriptions of the
views of the board (as geometry, as OX pattern, as OXO position, as
move-choosing position) that are discussed in detail in the OXO paper
(PPIG94paper.txt).  The only procedural aspects (or agents) in the
model are supplied by the 'play' action and the 'init_game' procedure
in the control.e file.

The main purpose of the OXO-like modelling exercise is to
illustrate how the conceptual framework associated with playing
such games can be captured by using Empirical Modelling methods.
This is best appreciated by experimenting with the scripts e.g.
by changing the geometry, rules of the game, evaluation strategy,
or the visualisation, and by investigating how singular behaviour
that arises in practice - such as memory lapses, or cheating -
can be emulated.

To start an OXO game, you should type
	init_game();

A version of standard OXO with a richer visualisation is provided in
the 'tk' directory.
