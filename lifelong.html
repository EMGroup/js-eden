<h1>Lifelong Learners</h1>
<p>All of us are lifelong learners whether in an everyday practical sense in such matters as  using transport, cooking, personal finance and health, or making use of technology; or the learning may be in more knowledge-based matters in (say) science, literature, astronomy, psychology, etc. Learning on such topics can be systematic and 'bracketed' as with college or online courses, but lifelong learning is characterised by being more informal, even haphazard, open-ended and never-ending. Here the learner is often more active than on a formal course and the role of 'making' is more prominent. So we think that 'making construals' may play a useful part in such learning. Can you help us explore this? You might begin looking at the construals on shopping or the solar system. </p>
