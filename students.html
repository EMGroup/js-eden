<h1>For Students</h1>
<p>Looking for something a bit off-beat?  - or even if you weren't - you've found it! This website has to do with something called 'making construals'.  Whether you are at school, or college, it's a fair bet you won't have heard about this before, nor will your teachers. It's fairly new. Construals are a kind of model (as in model aeroplane etc). They may look pretty weird so far but part of the point is what you can do with them. Very short ones are Dog and Whack-a-Mole. Try doing something with them .. if you are on the web (how else could you get here?) it should not be hard to turn the dog into another animal and make it move different ways ... For something a bit more interesting try Solar System or Adventures in a Lift. Sign-in (it's free) and open a construal - you should then see a 'save and share' icon appear. You can 'fork' a construal and save your own version. Not really many 'user guides' here (some under Reference) - it's a matter of 'try it and learn'!  Let us know what you think - use the 'Comment' icon bottom right. Have fun!</p>
