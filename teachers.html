<h1>For Teachers</h1>

<p>Making construals is an alternative way to develop educational resources. A construal serves as what Seymour Papert described as "an object-to-think-with". Making or interacting with a construal is a form of sense-making. It provokes thinking about "how something works". <a href="?load=27" target="_blank">The Penny Rolling construal</a> is an illustrative example.</p>

<p>The principles behind making construals link construction closely to the subject domain. Specifically, as in a spreadsheet, there are counterparts in the construal for the features that characterise the subject: the entities that are observed ("observables") and the relationships that connect changes to observables dynamically ("dependencies"). This makes it much simpler to specify meaningful interactions ("agency"), as happens when you change the value of a spreadsheet cell and dependent cells are suitably updated. The Scenes from <a href="?load=97" target="_blank">Shopping construal</a> explicitly illustrates the concepts of observable, dependency and agency.</p>

<p>Because of its intimate connection with the subject domain, a construal is a good medium for communication between the designers ("teachers"), users ("learners") and developers of educational technology. As an-object-to-converse-with, the construal can support rich communication in the collaborative design of OERs. This potential is illustrated in educational resources being developed for teaching about <a href="?load=83" target="_blank">sorting</a> and about the <a href="?load=86" target="_blank">solar system</a>.</p>

<p>The connection between subject domain expertise and construction can also be exploited as a way of introducing computing concepts. Making a construal can be viewed as giving computer support for computing unplugged activities. This approach leads to educational resources that can be customised and extended with an unusual degree of flexibility. This is illustrated in the <a href="?load=107" target="_blank">Giving Change</a> construal.</p>
