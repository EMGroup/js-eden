These jugs have capacities 5 and 7 respectively. From a <i>functional</i> perspective, you are intended to achieve the target quantity of liquid specified to the right of the jugs by filling, emptying and pouring.</p> <p>You can exercise the model as a program by pressing the buttons. For instance, there is a sequence of actions to reach the target in which you only ever <i>fill</i> jug A and <i>empty</i> jug B (and vice versa).</p> ");

Here the emphasis is on how the abstract operations performed on the jugs are informed by our rich experience of the physical world.
Consider for instance the meanings of the words 'fill', 'empty', 'pour', and the notion of 'content' and 'liquid'.
</p>
<p>
When viewed from a functional perspective, the JUGS model is seen as an essential simplification. The model and the operations are just enough to fulfill its purpose.
</p>
<p>
From the experiential perspective, the JUGS model is an impoverished representation of a referent - a representation that could be enriched in an open-ended fashion.

The idea behind EM is that the way in which the model is constructed is critical as far as supporting <i>both</i> these interpretations is concerned.

The observables on display are quite diverse in nature. Some of them (such as 'canvas' or 'slidelist' relate to meta aspects of the state of the artefact on display). It's useful to be able to isolate the observables of interest. Which these are of course depends on the context for observation.

For instance, to focus on the key parameters in the JUGS model from a functional perspective, cut-and-paste the following RE into the search box:
</p>
<b>
content[A!B]|^cap|target
</b>

<p>
This will display the target and the capacities and contents of the jugs. You can then see how the process of reaching the target is reflected in the values of these key observables.

If you want to make the updating process easier to see, you will need to change the value of the observable <code>viscosity</code>:

<b>
content[A!B]|^cap|target|visc

The buttons on the display provide one way of changing the values of observables. 
Such changes reflect the functional goal and follow a carefully crafted pattern.
The buttons give machine-like control over the state of the model.

<p>
In the present environment, there are many other ways in which the values of observables can be changed.
The model is constructed in such a way that changes that respect potential meanings are the most accessible.

<h3>Changing observable values</h3>
<p>Many different kinds of agency are relevant to the JUGS model.</p>
<p>The model was originally conceived as a way of encouraging <i>schoolchildren</i> to explore simple arithmetic operations that underlie elementary concepts in number theory.</p>
<p>
The <i>teacher</i> would want to change the jug capacities and/or the target. They might also want to adapt the interface to clarify the way the updating processes work.
</p>
<p>
Ways to change the values - and definitions - of observables are:
<ul>
<li>by double-clicking on the observable name in the <b>O&A</b> panel, and editing and saving its definition as then displayed in a textbox.</li>
<li>by directly entering a new definition via the Eden Interpreter Window.</li>
</ul>
It is also possible to enable the <i>presenter</i> to change values from within this presentation environment.
For instance, placing a piece of JS-EDEN script within &lt;jseden>...&lt;/jseden> tags allows the reader to execute the script, or copy it to the Eden Interpreter Window for editing prior to execution. There are some simple illustrations on the next slide.

<h3>Dependencies within the model</h3>
<p>The dependencies between observables in the JUGS model guide its possible interpretations.

Assigning <code>contentA</code> to <code>capA</code> confirms this:

You can trace the relevant dependencies by examining the following observables:

<b>

<h3>Agency in the JUGS model</h3>
<p>
The JUGS model brings out the contrasts alluded to by SBR.
</p>
<p>
Moving beyond the functional perspective gives scope for personal exploratory interaction.
</p>
<p>
The model supports different kinds of human agency (e.g. pupil, teacher, developer, presenter).
More significantly, it supports these kinds of agency <i>concurrently</i> in one and the same environment.
</p>
<p>
It also supports automated agency. 
To see this, inspect the definition of the <code>pour</code> procedure via the <b>Procedures</b> panel on the left.
(You need to empty the search box in the O&A panel for this to work - a bug in emile.) 
<p>
You will see that <code>pour</code> acts like an agent that carries out automatically what the modeller might do manually.
For instance, when B is being filled the content of Jug B is incremented and the fullness of Jug B is checked repeatedly.
You can disclose this by intervening in the filling process by resetting <code>contentB</code> thus:
</p>
<p>
<jseden>contentB = 1;</jseden>
