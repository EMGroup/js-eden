The files in this directory are intended to be used in conjunction
with the lab sessions in CS405 in 2013-14.

The 'JUGSinJS-E' and 'Rough Guide to JS-EDEN' presentations will be
developed from versions created in 2012-13 in connection with the emile
variant of JS-EDEN. For 2013-14, the lab work will be based on the master
variant.
