"<h1>What are construals? And what can you do with them?</h1>"
"Your construal of something (X) is 'how you think of X', it includes anything you might associate with X. Because you can visualise it, and interact with it, you can also make it on the computer. In fact making construals is a new way to use computers: one that is simpler, yet in some ways more powerful, than programming."
"What is exciting is that you can make construals behave like programs - but in an unusually open and flexible way. In particular, making construals is especially well-suited to learning in an engaging, personal fashion."
