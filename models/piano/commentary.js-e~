The construal has been built using the JS-EDEN interpreter. To load the construal:
<ul>
<li>Use a text editor to open the files: <b>musicapp1.js-e</b> and <b>piano.js-e</b></li>
<br>
<li>Cut-and-paste the content of the file <b>musicapp1.js-e</b> into the Input Window and press the Submit button.

The image of the keyboard is initially placed directly on top of the stave, and has to be moved downwards: 
You can redefine the position of the keyboard by making the new definition:

s2b is Slide("<h3>Basic features of the construal</h3><p>
The construal - as depicted on the HTML5 Canvas panel - has two components: a display of the treble and bass staves, and an associated keyboard.
The lines of the staves are highlighted in such a way that the top, middle and botton lines of each stave are black and other lines are grey.
The notes that correspond to the lines displayed in black play an important role in the construal.
The note on the stave highlighted in turqouise has been generated by selecting one of the black stave lines at random.
The corresponding key on the keyboard is highlighted in turquoise. 
</p>
<p>
To the right of the staves there is a 'Combobox' widget that allows the 'user' of the construal to select a note name from a drop down menu.
The six options available correspond one-to-one to notes on the six black stave lines.
When a selection is made, the corresponding note is displayed in red.
</p>
<p>
The depiction of the treble and bass staves is non-standard: the distance between the treble and bass staves is contrived so that the correspondence between lines and the keyboard is
easier to understand.
You can change the distance between the staves by giving different values to the observable bassY:
<jseden>bassY=90;</jseden>
</p>
<p>
For this purpose, you select <b>copy to input</b>, then edit and submit the definition in the Input Window.
Note that there is a missing dependency: moving the bass stave does not move the bass clef.

s3 is Slide("<h3>More about the construal</h3><p>
The construal comprises a family of <b>observables</b> subject to certain <b>dependencies</b>
that are reconfigurable both directly through the agency of the maker and indirectly through other agencies.
(For instance, in this particular construal, the observables that make up the piano keyboard have been generated dynamically and are displayed
in an <b>HTML View</b> panel. Each key on the keyboard is a rectangle defined by supplying different parameters to the function <code>keyVisual()</code>.)</p>
<p>
To inspect a sample of the observables in the model, you can instantiate a 'Symbol List' from the <b>Views</b> drop down
menu, and type a regular expression (RE) in to the search box at the top of the <b>Symbol List</b> panel to select a subset of observables.
Alternatively, you can display a specific family of observables by executing a showObservables command with a given RE as its argument:
<jseden>showObservables(\"bassY|keyboard|keyC.*1|pianoPosi|nat|picture$|sel|tbNo|treblebassNote_val|tbsel\");</jseden>
</p>
<p>
In the Symbol List, observables that have explicit values are
displayed in black, whilst whose values are defined by dependency are displayed in green.
You can inspect the definitions of observables displayed in green using mouseover.
To explore the construal further, you can redefine observables freely by entering new definitions for them via the Input Window.
For instance, you can see how the size of the keyboard is determined by the observable <b>naturalKeyWidth</b>, upon which the observable
<b>naturalKeyLength</b> depends:
<jseden>naturalKeyWidth = 15;</jseden>
</p>
<p>
To limit the size of the keyboard visualisation, it is convenient to make an assignment such as:
 <jseden>naturalKeyWidth = 10;</jseden>
</p>

s4 is Slide("<h3>Modifying the construal</h3><p>
As a simple exercise in the modifying the construal, we can introduce the 'missing dependency' between the position of the bass clef and the bass stave.
For this purpose, we can create a <b>Symbol Lookup Table</b> view, and enter the RE 'bass' into the search box at the top of it.
This gives comprehensive details of the current definitions and values of observables whose names have the form 'bass...'.
</p>
<p>
By inspection, we find the definition of the observable bassClef, viz:
<jseden>bassClef is Image(\"bassClef\", 27, 95, 28, 33,\"http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~wmb/bass_clef.png\");</jseden>
</p>
<p>
By refining the search in the <b>Symbol Lookup Table</b> to display the definition of the Image() function, it
becomes clear that the y-coordinate of the observable <b>bassClef</b> is explicitly defined above to be 95.
To remedy this, we can introduce an alternative definition to link the y-coordinate of the bass clef to the observable <b>bassY</b>:
<jseden>bassClef is Image(\"bassClef\", 27, bassY + 5, 28, 33,\"http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~wmb/bass_clef.png\");</jseden>
</p>
<p>
A similar redefinition can be made for the observable treble as follows:
<jseden>trebleClef is Image(\"trebleClef\", 9, trebleY - 6, 64, 68,\"http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~wmb/Treble_Clef_Pin.PNG\");</jseden>

This serves the additional purpose of positioning the treble clef more accurately on the stave.

One simple application of the construal involves testing whether users can name the randomly generated note highlighted in turquoise.
The internal mechanism for selecting this note and resetting the Combobox selection to '?' is as follows:
<jseden>
selnumt = int(random()*3);
tselnum is 2*selnumt;

selnumb = int(random()*3);
bselnum is 2*selnumb;

stavesel = int(random()*2);

</p>
<p>
Executing the above set of redefinitions then displays a random note and allows the user to try to select its name via the drop-down menu.
</p>
<p>
To refine this mechanism, we can wrap the above refinitions into a single procedure, removing the redundant redefinitions of <b>tselnum</b> and <b>bselnum</b>
which were included above for readability:
<jseden>
proc generaterandnote {
	selnumt = int(random()*3);
	selnumb = int(random()*3);
	stavesel = int(random()*2);
	treblebassNote_value = \"?\";
}
</jseden>

The most direct way to generat a new random note is to invoke the <b>generaterandnote</b> procedure directly:

An alternative way is to trigger the procedure from a mouseclick to the right of the generated note in the stave region:

s7 is Slide("<h3>Finger frames</h3><p>The main purpose of the construal is to capture other dependencies that can be helpful in learning to interpret music
from treble and bass staves on a keyboard.

These make use of the 'finger frame' concept devised by Megan Beynon.
A finger frame is represented by a box that can be moved up and down the stave by manipulating the value of the observable
<b>framenum</b>:

<jseden>
picture is [fingerFrame] // bass // treble // [ trebleClef, bassClef, tbnote, selnote, tbsel, leftline] // keyboard;
</jseden>
<p>
Incrementing and decrementing the observable <b>framenum</b> move the frame down and up respectively:
To move the frame down:
</p>

<jseden>
framenum++;
</jseden>
<p>
To move the frame up:
</p>
<p>
<jseden>
framenum--;
</jseden>
</p>
<p>
A simple dependency can be used to put finger labels on the five contiguous white notes that are associated with the finger frame:

<jseden>

fingerlabel1 is Text(\"5\", keyB4.x1 + 0.5*naturalKeyWidth - 3 - naturalKeyWidth * 2 * framenum, pianoPositionY + naturalKeyLength - 4, \"red\");

s8 is Slide("<h3>Refining finger frames</h3><p>

It is obvious that, in order to make the construal more effective as a teaching aid, there are many refinements to be made.
The way in which the finger indices are displayed (e.g. position and fontsize) could be improved, and should be configured to be
effective irrespective of the size of the keyboard display. The colours used to depict the finger frame on the stave and the
fingers on the keyboard should be coordinated. The movement of the finger frame could be managed by clicking on the frame.
None of these refinements is technically difficult to implement, but each requires knowledge of the observables concerned, and
the operators that are available (or can be readily written) that can be used to frame dependencies to relate them.

</p>
<p>
Several techniques can be used to find out about observables in the construal.
The use of the <b>Symbol List</b> and <b>Symbol Lookup Table</b> have already been illustrated.
It is also possible to obtain a listing of all the observables and dependencies in the construal by invoking a <b>Script Generator</b>,
and introducing a <b>Dependency Map</b> to explore the network of dependencies that links specific subsets of observables.
For instance, to find out what observables govern the width and length of the keys as displayed, we can identify some of the relevant observables by searching a Symbol List with the RE 'key', then entering the explicit names of keys on the piano (such as <bcode>keyCSharp4</code>) into a <b>Dependency Map</b>.
</p>
<p>
A standard technique for refinement is to replace explicit values by observables whose values can then be manipulated interactively or subsequently defined by dependency. 
<jseden>
fingerlabelYoffset = -4;

fingerlabel1 is Text(\"5\", keyB4.x1 + 0.5*naturalKeyWidth - 3 - naturalKeyWidth * 2 * framenum, pianoPositionY + naturalKeyLength + fingerlabelYoffset, \"red\");
fingerlabel2 is Text(\"4\", keyB4.x1 + 0.5*naturalKeyWidth - 3 + naturalKeyWidth * (1-2*framenum), pianoPositionY + naturalKeyLength + fingerlabelYoffset, \"red\");
fingerlabel3 is Text(\"3\", keyB4.x1 + 0.5*naturalKeyWidth - 3 + naturalKeyWidth * (2-2*framenum), pianoPositionY + naturalKeyLength + fingerlabelYoffset, \"red\");
fingerlabel4 is Text(\"2\", keyB4.x1 + 0.5*naturalKeyWidth - 3 + naturalKeyWidth * (3-2*framenum), pianoPositionY + naturalKeyLength + fingerlabelYoffset, \"red\");

</jseden>
</p>
<p>
This makes it possible to refine values by experiment. For instance:
<jseden>
fingerlabelYoffset = 12;
</jseden>
<jseden>
fingerlabelYoffset is (sharpKeyLength - naturalKeyLength) * 0.5 + 3;
</jseden>
</p>

");

s9 is Slide("<h3>Illustrating refinement of finger frames</h3><p>
An obvious refinement of the construal makes it possible to choose whether or not to use right-hand or left-hand finger labels.
To this end, we can introduce an observable that lists the finger indices in ascending or descending order according to whether
the right or left hand is being considered:
<jseden>
func takefrom6 {
	para n;
	return 6-n;
}

whichhand = \"R\";

fingeringLRhand is (whichhand == \"L\") ? map(str, map(takefrom6, [1,2,3,4,5])) : map(str, [1,2,3,4,5]) ;

<p>
To switch hands, we can then use:
<jseden>
whichhand = \"L\";
</jseden>
</p>
<p>

fingerlabel2 is Text(fingeringLRhand[2], keyB4.x1 + 0.5*naturalKeyWidth - 3 + naturalKeyWidth * (1-2*framenum), pianoPositionY + naturalKeyLength + fingerlabelYoffset, \"red\");
