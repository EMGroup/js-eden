To use the project-manager server requires a separate "npm install":
cd {PATH-TO-JSEDEN}/plugins/project-manager/pm-server
npm install

You'll need to create a config.js file (based on config-template.js) - you'll need to generate keys/ids/secrets for each authentication service - details available at http://passportjs.org/
