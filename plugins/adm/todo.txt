- more templating
- input boxes adapt to size of window
- don't completely fail at processing if eden code is invalid (catch exception)
- allow scrolling through agents, and deletion
- maybe add a view that is a list of current agents
- test for conflicting actions
- fix THEN syntax - just use if (guard) action; straight eden code?
- process iteratively through steps
