- input boxes adapt to size of window
- make current agents in list clickable
- delete agents from list when deleted from adm
- ability to edit agent descriptions / templates

- would really be super if updates happened when guards changed value...
- make guards eden-ish

*** human perspective ***
- make templates and parameterisation (parameters for identification)
- maybe make it so you can select multiple actions and execute all at once (spirit of concurrency)
