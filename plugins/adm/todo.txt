- input boxes adapt to size of window
- make current agents in list clickable
- delete agents from list when deleted from adm
- ability to edit agent descriptions / templates
- multiple instances of the same agent need entities to have differing names, and these appended to their entities.
- rename entities as definitions! Agents -> entities

*** human perspective ***
- make actions clickable
- be able to delete other "agents" within actions
- make templates and parameterisation (parameters for identification)
- if actions is a list, make it interleavable.
- maybe make it so you can select multiple actions and execute all at once (spirit of concurrency)
