- input boxes adapt to size of window
- make current agents in list clickable
- delete agents from list when deleted from adm
- ability to edit agent descriptions / templates

*** human perspective ***
- make templates and parameterisation (parameters for identification)
- queue actions per agent
- maybe make it so you can select multiple actions and execute all at once (spirit of concurrency)

*** bugs
- icon stays on list
